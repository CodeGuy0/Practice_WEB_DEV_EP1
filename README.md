# Practice_WEB_DEV_EP1

In this project, I created a front-page clone of the portfolio website of Cynthia Ugwu,<br>
a Product Designer. This website serves as an excellent demonstration <br>
of modern web development techniques, focusing on animations, interactions, and smooth user experiences.

# Overview

The project involved building a pixel-perfect clone of Cynthia Ugwu's portfolio <br>
website's front page. The goal was to replicate the design and implement <br> 
advanced animations and interactions using various JavaScript libraries.

# Tech Stack

-> HTML: For the structure and content of the website. <br>

-> CSS: For styling and layout. <br>

-> JavaScript: For interactivity and animations.<br>

# JavaScript Libraries and Features Used:

-> GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): <br>

1. Used for smooth animations, including mouse movement and image movement. <br>

2. Integrated advanced effects such as fade-ins, rotations, and element transitions. <br>

-> Locomotive Scroll: <br>

1. Implemented for smooth scrolling and parallax effects. <br>

2. Enhanced the overall user experience by adding inertia to scrolling. <br>

-> ScrollTrigger (GSAP Plugin): <br>

1. Triggered animations based on scroll position. <br>

2. Created seamless interactions that activate as the user scrolls through the page. <br>
